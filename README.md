# Kitchen Time 

Kitchen-Time is a JavaScript application that fetches and displays recipe meal data using the Forkify API. This program makes use of modern JavaScript technologies like Parcel and Babel to bundle the modules and convert ES6, ES7, and ES8 back to ES5. The user may utilize local storage to search for a certain recipe and store it to a favorites list. The user may quickly raise or reduce portions as needed, and thorough instructions can be shown.
